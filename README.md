Create a grid with JS that will change color when one hovers over with the mouse 

Project Goals: 
o Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs with JS

o Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

o Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before
